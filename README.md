Here is a 600-word project description for a *File Handling Utility, including the technologies used, project functionality, and development process using **Java*:


### *Technologies Used*

1. *Java SE (Standard Edition)*

   * Java is the core programming language used for the project due to its powerful built-in libraries for file and directory manipulation.

2. *Java I/O Classes*

   * java.io.File for basic file operations.
   * FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter for reading and writing text files.
   * FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, and BufferedInputStream for binary file operations.
   * java.nio.file package (e.g., Files, Paths) for more efficient file handling and newer methods introduced in Java 7+.

3. *Exception Handling*

   * Use of try-catch-finally blocks to handle IOException, FileNotFoundException, and other runtime exceptions.

4. *Collections Framework (Optional)*

   * Used to store, process, and filter file names or data from the files.

5. *Java Swing or Command-Line Interface (CLI)*

   * *CLI* is typically used for simplicity and automation.
   * Optionally, *Java Swing* can be used to build a GUI for users to select files and directories visually.

6. *IDE and Build Tools*

   * Developed using *Eclipse, **IntelliJ IDEA, or **NetBeans*.
   * Build automation with *Maven* or *Gradle* if needed.


### *Key Functionalities*

1. *Read Files*

   * Read text files line by line or as a whole using BufferedReader.
   * Read binary files using FileInputStream.

2. *Write Files*

   * Write content to a file using FileWriter or BufferedWriter.
   * Support for appending to existing files.

3. *Copy and Move Files*

   * Copy and move files from one location to another using Files.copy() and Files.move().

4. *Rename and Delete Files*

   * Rename files and directories using the File.renameTo() method.
   * Delete single files or recursively delete directories.

5. *List Directory Contents*

   * Display all files in a directory using File.list() or Files.list().

6. *Search Files by Name or Extension*

   * Filter files using custom search logic (e.g., .txt, .log, .jpg).

7. *File Size and Metadata*

   * Display file size, last modified time, and file permissions.

8. *Create Logs*

   * Log activities like file creation, deletion, and errors for audit purposes.


### *Use Cases and Applications*

* *System Utilities*: Automate tasks like backups, data cleaning, and folder organization.
* *Data Processing*: Read and write data from CSV, TXT, or XML files for batch processing.
* *Software Tools*: Backend support for applications that require file uploads/downloads.
* *Log Management*: Store logs and rotate them periodically based on size or date.
* *Educational Tools*: Teach file I/O concepts to programming students.


### *Advantages of the Project*

* *Automation*: Saves time on manual file operations.
* *Reusability*: Methods can be reused across multiple Java projects.
* *Scalability*: Can be extended to support compression, encryption, or file watching.
* *Cross-Platform*: Runs on any OS with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
